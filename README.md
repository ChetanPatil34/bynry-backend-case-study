## Introduction

This repository contains my solution to the backend engineering case study shared as part of the Bynry internship hiring process.

The objective of this case study was to evaluate backend problem-solving skills, database design understanding, and the ability to work with incomplete or ambiguous requirements in a real-world SaaS context.

Rather than focusing on a fully runnable application, this solution emphasizes **design decisions, reasoning, and clarity of thought**, which are critical for backend engineering roles.

## Case Study Overview

The case study is divided into three main parts:

1. **Code Review & Debugging**  
   Reviewing an existing API implementation, identifying technical and logical issues, explaining their impact, and proposing improved solutions.

2. **Database Design**  
   Designing a scalable database schema to support multi-warehouse inventory management, suppliers, and bundled products.

3. **Low Stock Alert API**  
   Designing an API endpoint that generates low-stock alerts based on business rules such as thresholds, recent sales activity, and supplier information.

Each section is documented separately for better readability and structure.
